  <h1>Persona 5</h1>
  <p>Persona 5 is a 2016 role-playing video game developed by Atlus. It takes place in modern-day Tokyo and follows a high school student known by the pseudonym Joker who transfers to a new school after being falsely accused of assault and put on probation. Over the course of a school year, he and other students awaken to a special power, becoming a group of secret vigilantes known as the Phantom Thieves of Hearts.</p>
  <p>They explore the Metaverse, a supernatural realm born from humanity's subconscious desires, to steal malevolent intent from the hearts of adults. As with previous games in the series, the party battles enemies known as Shadows using physical manifestations of their psyche known as their Personas. The game incorporates role-playing and dungeon crawling elements alongside social simulation scenarios.</p>
  <p>Pro and cons:</p>
  <p>As a pro the game itself is overall fun to play for newcomers to gaming since it can be more wide when it comes to it side quests and hanging with your confidents.</p>
  <p>As a con during certain plot points in the story they give a certain date for you to complete with you have to do so in a way if your to layback u can fail very hard if you push that luck.</p>
